# Prochlorococcus Abundancy Relation with Particulate Organic Matter in the Water Column - Austin Karpf
# My project was about seeing the relationship between prochlorococcus abundancy in comparsion with particulate organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the water column. Since prochlorococcus have begun to adapt a more mixotrophic lifestyle, my goal was to see if we would find them around POM in the water column at depths of up to 260m (past sunlight penetration). I then did a comparison of the marker pigment from prochlorococcus divinyl chlorophyll a in the water column to see if that matched up as well. They all did!
